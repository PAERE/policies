At PAERE, we believe in creating through re-imaging the way we exist in the world through
technology. This involves a spirit of integrity, an openness to new weird ideas and approaches, and an
energy for exploring the unknown. To cultivate this experience, working on a project requires a safe
space of acceptance while learning and growing together, the embrace of mistakes and an attitude of
overcoming of failures. Being part of this team means you are committed to that experience
wherever it may lead. We may have meetings in different locations, or eat chocolate by the lake as
meeting. All meetings will respect the paid 4 hour limit and you are not expected to work outside this
time commitment.
