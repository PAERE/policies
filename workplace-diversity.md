In keeping with our mission as stipulated on our website PAERE is committed to social justice and
diversity. We welcome all who share our mission and want to help, and are determined that those
who need our service have full access. We continue to provide services to all people in need, without
regard to race, ancestry, place or origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, religion, gender,
sexual orientation, age, marital status, same-sex partnership status, family status, or disability.
To ensure our services are free of barriers, employee diversity is an integral part of PAERE’s business
practices. Individual differences are respected and valued. Fair and equitable treatment will apply to
all aspects of employment. To ensure this, PAERE will actively remove barriers to ensure that each
person has equal access to the benefits of employment. Pro-active accommodation at work will be
provided, where necessary and reasonably practical, to provide ways that support the employee’s
dignity, worth and productivity, or to hire or retain qualified employees disabled through either injury
or illness, or otherwise belonging to groups protected under the applicable Human Rights Code.
